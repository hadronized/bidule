//! The bidule FRP crate.
//!
//! This crate provides a few simple primitives to write FRP-driven programs. Everything revolves
//! around the concept of a `Stream`.
//!
//! # Streams
//!
//! A `Stream` is a *stream of typed signals*. A stream of signals will get a *signal* as input
//! and will broadcast it downwards. You can compose streams with each other with very simple
//! combinators, such as `map`, `filter`, `filter_map`, `zip`, `unzip`, `merge`, `fold`, `sink`,
//! etc.
//!
//! ## Creating streams and send signals
//!
//! Streams are typed. You can use type inference or give them an explicit type:
//!
//! ```
//! use bidule::Stream;
//!
//! let my_stream: Stream<i32> = Stream::new();
//! ```
//!
//! That’s all you need to create a stream. A stream represent a value that will be flowing in *at
//! some time*.
//!
//! > Even though it’s not strictly the same thing, you can see a similitude with
//! > [futures](https://crates.io/crates/futures).
//!
//! When you’re ready to send signals, just call the `send` function:
//!
//! ```
//! use bidule::Stream;
//!
//! let my_stream: Stream<i32> = Stream::new();
//!
//! my_stream.send(&1);
//! my_stream.send(&2);
//! my_stream.send(&3);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Subscriptions
//!
//! A single stream like that one won’t do much – actually, it’ll do nothing. The first thing we
//! might want to do is to subscribe a closure to do something when a signal is emitted. This is
//! done with the `subscribe` function.
//!
//! ```
//! use bidule::Stream;
//!
//! let my_stream: Stream<i32> = Stream::new();
//! 
//! my_stream.subscribe(|sig| {
//!   // print the signal on stdout each time it’s flowing in
//!   println!("signal: {:?}", sig);
//! });
//!
//! my_stream.send(&1);
//! my_stream.send(&2);
//! my_stream.send(&3);
//! ```
//!
//! ## FRP basics
//!
//! However, FRP is not about callbacks. It’s actually the opposite, to be honest. We try to reduce
//! the use of callbacks as much as possible. FRP solves this by inversing the way you must work:
//! instead of subscribing callbacks to react to something, you transform that something to create
//! new values or objects. This is akin to the kind of transformations you do with `Future`.
//!
//! Let’s get our feet wet: let’s create a new stream that will only emit signals for even values:
//!
//! ```
//! use bidule::Stream;
//!
//! let int_stream: Stream<i32> = Stream::new();
//! let even_stream = int_stream.filter(|x| x % 2 == 0);
//! ```
//!
//! `even_stream` has type `Stream<i32>` and will only emit signals when the input signal is `even`.
//!
//! Let’s try something more complicated: on those signals, if the value is less or equal to 10,
//! output `"Hello, world!"`; otherwise, output `"See you!"`.
//!
//! ```
//! use bidule::Stream;
//!
//! let int_stream: Stream<i32> = Stream::new();
//! let even_stream = int_stream.filter(|x| x % 2 == 0);
//! let str_stream = even_stream.map(|x| if *x <= 10 { "Hello, world!" } else { "See you!" });
//! ```
//!
//! This is really easy; no trap involved.
//!
//! Ok, let’s try something else. Some kind of a *Hello world* for FRP.
//!
//! ```
//! use bidule::Stream;
//!
//! enum Button {
//!   Pressed,
//!   Released
//! }
//!
//! fn unbuttonify(button: &Button, v: i32) -> Option<i32> {
//!   match *button {
//!     Button::Released => Some(v),
//!     _ => None
//!   }
//! }
//!
//! let minus = Stream::new();
//! let plus = Stream::new();
//! let counter =
//!   minus.filter_map(|b| unbuttonify(b, -1))
//!        .merge(&plus.filter_map(|b| unbuttonify(b, 1)))
//!        .fold(0, |a, x| a + x);
//! ```
//!
//! In this snippet, we have two buttons: `minus` and `plus`. If we hit the `minus` button, we want
//! a counter to be decremented and if we hit the `plus` button, the counter must increment.
//!
//! FRP solves that problem by expressing `counter` in terms of both `minus` and `plus`. The first
//! thing we do is to map a number on the stream that broadcasts button signals. Whenever that
//! signal is a `Button::Released`, we return a given number. For `minus`, we return `-1` and for
//! `plus`, we return `1` – or `+1`, it’s the same thing. That gives us two new streams. Let’s see
//! the types to have a deeper understanding:
//!
//! - `minus: Stream<Button>`
//! - `plus: Stream<Button>`
//! - `minus.filter_map(|b| unbuttonify(b, -1)): Stream<i32>`
//! - `plus.filter_map(|b| unbuttonify(b, 1)): Stream<i32>`
//!
//! The `merge` method is very simple: it takes two streams that emit the same type of signals and
//! merges them into a single stream that will broadcasts both the signals:
//!
//! - `minus.filter_map(|b| unbuttonify(b, -1)).merge(plus.filter_map(|b| unbuttonify(b, 1)): Stream<i32>): Stream<i32>`
//!
//! The next and final step is to `fold` those `i32` into the final value of the counter by applying
//! successive additions. This is done with the `fold` method, that takes the initial value – in the
//! case of a counter, it’s `0` – and the function to accumulate, with the accumulator as first
//! argument and the iterated value as second argument.
//!
//! The resulting stream, which type is `Stream<i32>`, will then contain the value of the counter.
//! You can test it by sending `Button` signals on both `minus` and `plus`: the resulting signal
//! in `counter` will be correctly decrementing or incrementing.
//!
//! There exist several more, interesting combinators to work with your streams. For instance, if
//! you don’t want to map a function over two streams to make them compatible with each other – they
//! have different types, you can still perform some kind of a merge. That operation is called a
//! `zip` and the resulting stream will yield either the value from the first – left – stream or the
//! value of the other – right – as soon as a signal is emitted. Its dual method is called `unzip`
//! and will split a stream apart into two streams if it’s a zipped stream. See `Either` for further
//! details.
//!
//! ## Sinking
//!
//! *Sinking* is the action to consume the signals of a stream and collect them. The current
//! implementation uses non-blocking buffering when sending signals, and reading is up to you: the
//! stream will collect the output signals in a buffer you can read via the
//! [Iterator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html) trait. For instance,
//! non-blocking reads:
//!
//! ```
//! use bidule::Stream;
//!
//! enum Button {
//!   Pressed,
//!   Released
//! }
//!
//! fn unbuttonify(button: &Button, v: i32) -> Option<i32> {
//!   match *button {
//!     Button::Released => Some(v),
//!     _ => None
//!   }
//! }
//!
//! let minus = Stream::new();
//! let plus = Stream::new();
//! let counter =
//!   minus.filter_map(|b| unbuttonify(b, -1))
//!        .merge(&plus.filter_map(|b| unbuttonify(b, 1)))
//!        .fold(0, |a, x| a + x);
//!
//! let rx = counter.sink();
//!
//! // do something with minus and plus
//! // …
//!
//! for v in rx.try_iter() {
//!   println!("read a new value of the counter: {}", v);
//! }
//! ```
